# Amazon Vine Review of Video Games

## Overview
- The purpose of this analysis was to use Google Colab and PySpark in order to determine who reviewed video games.

## Results
- In total there were 94 paid vine reviews and 40,471 unpaid vine reviews.
- There were 48 paid 5 star reviews, meaning 51% of the reviews were 5 star.
- There were 15,663 unpaid 5 star reviews, meaning 39% of the reviews were 5 star.

## Summary
- Clearly, there were a lot more reviews for unpaid vine users than paid vine users. This means that the accounts that were reviewing are free accounts that anyone can make and are easily to make.  A single person could make many accounts and review the same product multiple times. This could happen with paid accounts but is much less likely due to a charge being enforced.
